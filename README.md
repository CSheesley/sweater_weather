# Sweater Weather

This is a solo project completed at the Turing School of Software & Design - as the last project of Module 3 (Professional Rails Applications). The goal of this project was to build out a number of API endpoints which would provide the necessary information for creating a mock web page (below). In order to do achieve this, multiple external API's were called, Models and PORO's were created, and custom Serializers were used.
